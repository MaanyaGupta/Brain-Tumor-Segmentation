Brain-Tumor-Segmentation Using UNET

This project focuses on the application of the U-Net convolutional neural network for segmenting brain tumors from MRI scans. It addresses the challenge of accurately identifying tumor boundaries within the complex structures of the brain, crucial for effective treatment planning and monitoring. Leveraging the power of machine learning and the U-Net architecture, this project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor segmentation in medical imaging.
